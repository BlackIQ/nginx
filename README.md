# My Beloved Customized NGINX

Welcome to my custom NGINX Docker image! Built with love and care, this lightweight, flexible web server is ready to serve your apps with style. Based on `nginx:alpine`, it’s designed to be reusable across projects by letting you mount your own SSL certificates, config files, and web content at runtime. No more rebuilding for every tweak—just pure, simple elegance.
